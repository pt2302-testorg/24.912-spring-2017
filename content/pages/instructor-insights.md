## Instructor Insights

{{< quote "So why #StayWoke for the course?&nbsp; Well, I love it because it’s one of these phrases that take a very complex concept and make it accessible to the larger public. (It’s) a way to talk about critical consciousness . . . (and) it means to be alert to the kind of propaganda that passes for history." "— Michel DeGraff" >}}

In the following videos, Professor Michel DeGraff describes various aspects of how he teaches _24.912 Black Matters: Introduction to Black Studies_.

## Guest Speaker Insights

{{< quote "Any interchange with the world that will improve it, that will deal with the innumerable problems that exist, has to be based on an understanding of social, political, and economic realities—otherwise you can’t act in any serious way." "— Noam Chomsky" >}}

Professor Emeritus Noam Chomsky was a featured guest lecturer in _24.912 Black Matters: Introduction to Black Studies_. Prior to facilitating a classroom discussion with students, he sat down with the OCW Educator Project Manager to share his insights about contemporary language issues and the value of the course materials for learners. The following videos capture excerpts of their conversation.

### Instructor Insights on Assessment

A {{% resource_link 53eb06cd-7b3e-79fb-df11-1d7113543de6 "rubric" "#rubric" %}} was used to assess student writing.

## Student Information

### Enrollment

19 students

### Breakdown by Year

Mostly juniors and seniors, a few freshmen and sophomores

### Breakdown by Major

Students were concentrating in a variety of majors.

### Typical Student Background

A few students in the course were children of undocumented migrant workers. The sharing of their personal biographies enriched the course because it allowed students who had not had this experience to begin to deconstruct the notion of “illegal immigrants.” Through discussions with their peers, they came to understand that there are acts that are illegal, but that people cannot be illegal.
